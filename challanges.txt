Find cycle
Eulerian tour
++ hard
Tarjan algorithm (lay out graph without crossing edges)
Hamiltonian cycle
++ Fucking hard
Isomorphism


Path. Is there a path between s and t ?
Shortest path. What is the shortest path between s and t ?
Cycle. Is there a cycle in the graph?
Euler tour. Is there a cycle that uses each edge exactly once?
Hamilton tour. Is there a cycle that uses each vertex exactly once.
Connectivity. Is there a way to connect all of the vertices?
MST. What is the best way to connect all of the vertices?
Biconnectivity. Is there a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph?
Planarity. Can you draw the graph in the plane with no crossing edges
Graph isomorphism. Do two adjacency lists represent the same graph?
